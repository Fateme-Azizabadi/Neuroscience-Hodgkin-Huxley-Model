# Neuroscience- Hodgkin Huxley Model

**Neuroscience-Hodgkin-Huxley-Model**

In this project, we used Matlab to simulate the dynamics of a neuron that behaves according to the equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.

The Hodgkin-Huxley model equations are as follows:

In these constant equations, the times and stable states are as follows:

The time constant and steady-state graphs of m, n, and h in terms of voltage are drawn as follows.
